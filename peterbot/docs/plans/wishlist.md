I have to be upfront with you: using a regex blacklist to secure shell execution is a losing battle. Attackers know about regex filters and have dozens of ways to bypass them using shell quirks. If you just block the word rm, an attacker can execute the exact same command using any of these bypasses:

mastra agents
approvals or human in the loop section

integrations instead of env
petabot opinionated - composio, google telegram

auto complete (slash commands)
chat should auto scroll down

rebrand to peetabot - get domain

natural language instead of slash commands
